How To Build
-------------------------------------------------
Open up terminal and change directory to the location
of 'assignment3.cpp'. Enter the command 'make craps' to
compile and build the executable. Proceed to run
the executable, or type './assignment3 < file.dat' in
terminal, where 'file.dat' is the file you wish to
read.
*************************************************
How to use
-------------------------------------------------
This program checks the identified file (refer to
How to Build) for words, and their frequency. It 
will only check for words, excluding numbers, 
symbols and spaces. It can only read up to 30
words, and each word can only be a maximum 19
characters, and any extra words or characters
will be dropped with a prompt. After it has
searched the file and made it's data, it will
output it's results in Terminal. For examples
of how the output works, run the program and direct
it to "examplefile" or "examplefile2". The following
shows the file, and it's respective output:
